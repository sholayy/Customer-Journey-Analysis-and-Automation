# Advanced Customer Analytics & Platform Optimization Study

## Project Overview 
At Send-a-Tree, a digital-to-physical gifting platform, I implemented comprehensive data engineering and analytics solutions to optimize user conversion through a multi-stage customer journey. The project involved building automated data pipelines, developing advanced analytics systems, and implementing machine learning models to drive data-informed decision-making.
## Objective
The goal was to analyze customer behavior data for a send-a-tree startup over 200+ days, providing valuable insights to help founders and the marketing team make informed decisions about revenue generation, customer segmentation, user engagement, and growth strategies.
## Business Questions Answered

Which customer acquisition channels delivered the highest conversion rates to paying customers?
What were the patterns in user progression through our funnel from registration to payment?
How did device type influence purchase behavior and revenue generation?
Which demographic segments (by age/birth year) showed the strongest revenue potential?
How did user behavior evolve over their first 30 days on the platform?
Could we accurately predict device types from user behavior when explicit data was missing?"

## DATA VISUALIZATION
### 1. Revenue Source Analysis

### Key Findings:
  * Distinct revenue patterns across different acquisition channels, with emphasis on super tree conversion rates
  * Clear correlation between source type and progression to paying customer status
  * Seasonal variations in both free tree and super tree sending patterns
  * Statistical significance in revenue distribution patterns across user journey stages (p < 0.05)
### 2. User Activity Metrics

### Key Findings:
  * 7-day rolling average of daily active users across all journey stages
  * Platform-specific engagement patterns from registration to paying customer status
  * Peak usage time identification for both free tree and super tree sending
  * Correlation between activity levels and conversion rates through each funnel stage

### 3. Cohort Retention Analysis

* Key Findings:
    * First 30-day user journey mapping showing progression through all four stages
    * Retention patterns by acquisition source, with focus on invitation-based acquisitions
    * Day-by-day engagement progression from registration to paying customer status
    * Key drop-off points identified between each journey stage

  ## Impact & Results 
* Invitation-based users show 20% conversion rate from registration to paying customers
* Android platform demonstrates superior performance metrics across all journey stages
* A clear correlation between initial engagement (free tree sending) and progression to paying customer status
* Real-time data processing capabilities tracking all journey stages
* Platform-specific strategies for increasing super tree conversion rates
* Lifetime value variations by acquisition channel and initial engagement patterns
* Clear monetization pathways from free tree to super tree users
* ROI analysis by marketing channel with focus on paying customer conversion

  ## Recommendations
Based on the comprehensive analysis of customer journey and platform performance, we recommend the following high-impact initiatives:
* Scale the referral program with targeted incentives, capitalizing on the 20% conversion rate from registration to paying customers
* Implement automated referral tracking and reward distribution system
* Prioritize Android platform optimization based on superior conversion metrics
* Enhance the super tree offering visibility to free tree senders through targeted prompts
* Enhance predictive modeling to identify high-potential
