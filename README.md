# Advanced Customer Analytics & Platform Optimization Study

## Project Overview 
At Send-a-Tree, a digital-to-physical gifting platform, I implemented comprehensive data engineering and analytics solutions to optimize user conversion through a multi-stage customer journey. The project involved building automated data pipelines, developing advanced analytics systems, and implementing machine learning models to drive data-informed decision-making.
## Objective
To implement data-driven optimization strategies by analyzing the four-stage customer journey (Registration → Free Tree → Super Tree → Paying Customer), understanding conversion patterns, and identifying opportunities to increase the progression rate through each stage of the funnel.
## Methodology & Technical Infrastructure
### Data Engineering Pipeline
* Implemented automated data collection using bash scripting with while loops for 160+ days of historical data, ensuring comprehensive tracking of customer progression through all stages
* Developed categorization system using command line operations for registration status sorting, enabling clear segmentation of users at each journey stage
* Established automated ETL pipeline using crontab for scheduled downloads and PostgreSQL integration
* PostgreSQL integration for structured data storage and analysis ensuring real-time tracking of customer journey progression

## DATA VISUALIZATION
### 1. Revenue Source Analysis

### Key Findings:
  * Distinct revenue patterns across different acquisition channels, with emphasis on super tree conversion rates
  * Clear correlation between source type and progression to paying customer status
  * Seasonal variations in both free tree and super tree sending patterns
  * Statistical significance in revenue distribution patterns across user journey stages (p < 0.05)
### 2. User Activity Metrics

### Key Findings:
  * 7-day rolling average of daily active users across all journey stages
  * Platform-specific engagement patterns from registration to paying customer status
  * Peak usage time identification for both free tree and super tree sending
  * Correlation between activity levels and conversion rates through each funnel stage

### 3. Cohort Retention Analysis

* Key Findings:
    * First 30-day user journey mapping showing progression through all four stages
    * Retention patterns by acquisition source, with focus on invitation-based acquisitions
    * Day-by-day engagement progression from registration to paying customer status
    * Key drop-off points identified between each journey stage

  ## Impact & Results 
* Invitation-based users show 20% conversion rate from registration to paying customers
* Android platform demonstrates superior performance metrics across all journey stages
* A clear correlation between initial engagement (free tree sending) and progression to paying customer status
* Real-time data processing capabilities tracking all journey stages
* Platform-specific strategies for increasing super tree conversion rates
* Lifetime value variations by acquisition channel and initial engagement patterns
* Clear monetization pathways from free tree to super tree users
* ROI analysis by marketing channel with focus on paying customer conversion

  ## Recommendations
Based on the comprehensive analysis of customer journey and platform performance, we recommend the following high-impact initiatives:
### Optimize Invitation-Based Growth
* Scale the referral program with targeted incentives, capitalizing on the 20% conversion rate from registration to paying customers
* Implement automated referral tracking and reward distribution system
### Platform & User Experience
* Prioritize Android platform optimization based on superior conversion metrics
* Enhance the super tree offering visibility to free tree senders through targeted prompts
* Implement strategic pricing tiers based on user engagement patterns
### Data-Driven Decision Making
* Deploy real-time funnel monitoring with automated alerts for conversion rate anomalies
* Implement A/B testing framework focusing on critical conversion points:
  * Free tree to super tree transition
  * First-time to repeat super tree sender conversion
* Enhance predictive modeling to identify high-potential
