## Executive Summary
This comprehensive analysis leverages advanced data engineering and analytics methodologies to decode customer behavior patterns and optimize platform performance for Send-a-Tree, an innovative digital-to-physical gifting startup. The study encompasses over 200 days of customer data, focusing on the critical customer journey from registration through to becoming paying customers, utilizing automated data pipelines, sophisticated SQL analytics, and machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights.
## Objective
To implement data-driven optimization strategies by analyzing the four-stage customer journey (Registration → Free Tree → Super Tree → Paying Customer), understanding conversion patterns, and identifying opportunities to increase the progression rate through each stage of the funnel.
## Methodology & Technical Infrastructure
### Data Engineering Pipeline
* Implemented automated data collection using bash scripting with while loops for 160+ days of historical data, ensuring comprehensive tracking of customer progression through all stages
* Developed categorization system using command line operations for registration status sorting, enabling clear segmentation of users at each journey stage
* Established automated ETL pipeline using crontab for scheduled downloads and PostgreSQL integration
* Created robust psql command integration for seamless database updates, ensuring real-time tracking of customer journey progression

  ## Key Insights & Strategic Implications
### 1. User Acquisition Dynamics
